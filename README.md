### 🚀 About Me

I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering Program (Back-End Developer track)**, passionate about **building scalable, reliable, and meaningful software solutions**.

💡 **Why I chose software engineering:**  
I believe technology has the power to transform lives, break down barriers, and create opportunities where none existed. I started this journey because I wanted to become someone who builds **back-end systems that make a real impact**, improve people’s access to essential services, and contribute to solving real-world challenges.

🔥 **What inspires me:**  
I am driven by the excitement of **problem-solving, continuous learning, and working with others to create tools that matter**. I’m inspired by how small lines of code can lead to big changes, especially in sectors like healthcare, education, and social impact.

🎯 **My vision:**  
My aim is to **develop robust back-end systems** that improve lives, open new opportunities, and make technology more accessible, particularly in underserved communities.
